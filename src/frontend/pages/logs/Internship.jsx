        <p className='mb-4'>
            Alright, let's get some things straight before you start reading this:
        </p>

        <ol className='list-disc list-outside mb-4 space-y-2'>

            <span className='font-bold'>I am not some internship wizard</span> 
            <p></p>
            You'll see people on LinkedIn with 7 FAANG internships who started coding out of the womb
            but that's not me. I'm learning too! The first time I ever touched code was actually somewhere in January of 2023 in Python. Think of this blog as a checklist for when you are looking to get employed. Checking these off will likely increase your chances but can never
            guarantee that you'll land one. These are just tips which I feel helped me land my first ever internship at TD. Hope for the best, but always prepare for the worst.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>A lot of it comes down to luck</span>
            <p></p>
            Even if you LeetCode in your sleep, nothing stops the hiring manager from picking a better qualified individual.
            Or even their old highschool buddy who's never touched code but has a great sense of humor. Focus on what is in your hands and leave the rest for fate to decide.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, to understand how to land an internship, we need to first understand why companies 
            even hire interns in the first place. A lot of people nowadays believe that interns don't actually provide any value to the company they're with. This is simply false. So:
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why Hire Interns */}
      <div className='mb-6 space-y-2'>

        <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 underline'>Why hire interns?</h1>

        <ol className='list-disc list-outside space-y-2'>
          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>It's an investment</span>
            <p></p>
            Companies hire interns to give them a trial version of what it would be like to work there full-time. Realistically,
            companies know that interns are not going to invent a new massively efficient process saving them billions BUT:
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>Interns provide value</span>
            <p></p>
            Firstly, a lot of interns bring valuable technical expertise to the table. If they are technically sound, they are able
            to pick up pace and get close to the level of work being done by a Junior Developer. Secondly, interns are usually from the younger
            generation. This allows them to have a unique way of looking at problems and bring a fresh set of eyes. Most of the time, 
            if someone has been in the industry long enough, they tend to get used to the norm but interns challenge this for the better.
            This is why companies look for curiosity and ambition to learn while hiring!
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>Great marketing</span>
            <p></p>
            This one's a little debatable but it makes sense in my opinion. 
            Our generation tends to post everything on social media. A few nice LinkedIn posts about your experience at your internship
            is enough for people to remember that oh that guy had an internship at said company, sounds like a nice place. And then, next time
            they see a job posting from that company, they'll be more likely to apply. This makes it easier for the company to hire younger, full-timers
            which gives them all return-on-investment they needed. And the cycle continues.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

        <p className='mb-4'>
            Now, we can reverse-engineer a checklist such that we do our best to meet these demands and land that return offer. But, all of these will only be applied after we actually
            get the internship and join :( . So, let's take another step back and talk about how you can maximize those chances using some more reverse engineering. There are 10000000000000
            main topics I'll cover which will help you do this (in no particular order):
        </p>

      {/* Skill */}
      <div className='mb-6'>

        <div className='space-y-2 mb-6'>

           <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold underline mb-4'>Skillset</h1>
           

          <p>
            Though I said this list was in no particular order, I'd argue that this point is the most important. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
              Expanding your skillset will likely be your best bet at landing an internship. It's simple: the industry hires skill. You can follow all the tutorials you can find on YouTube
              about builing AIs from scratch, autonomous driving, etc... but, if you don't learn anything from them, those projects are not worth much. The second you land that interview and 
              the hiring manager asks you about details about said projects, it's over for you. The same happens if you vibe-code all the time.
          </p>
        </div>

            The only thing that sets us apart from AI is that we are capable of creative thinking and solving real problems. If we ourselves just start using Chat to code everything for us, sure we might win a few hackathons
            and impress a few people but we aren't gaining anything in the long-run. All of this is obviously much easier said that done, so how can you actually get better at coding? (or anything for that
            matter):
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className='font-bold'>Consistency.</span> Spend a week researching where your interests lie. If you figure it out, great! Make it your goal to do any sort of work on the topic for at least
            1 hour a day, but you have to be consistent. There are thousands of videos, blogs, documentations, and resources online which you can spend time watching. Remember, ANY work is always better that no work.
            No progress: 1.00<sup>365</sup> = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Even just 1% progress daily: 1.01<sup>365</sup> â‰ˆ <span className='font-bold'>37.78</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you can't figure it out, make it your goal to reasearch for an hour a day, I'm sure you'll land on something eventually. I'd also recommmend you focus on one
            thing and not dabble in too much or else you become a master of none. Companies prefer when you are highly specialized in one field as that way you become a rare resource. 
            Very few people are highly specialized nowadays and most people know the basics of a lot of things. Find your passion and dive into it.
          </p>

        </div>
        
      </div>

      {/* Network */}
      <div className='mb-6 space-y-2'>
        
        <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 underline'>Network</h1>

        <p>
            A lady at our orientation day at TD said that <span className='font-light'>"My network is my net worth"</span> and 
            it was a little cheesy but very true. Even if you're an introvert, try to meet people whenever you can and setup meaningful coffee chats with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The best practice for a coffee chat is to have geniune interest in what the person does and their history. Put yourself in their shoes. 
            If someone you've never met before reached out to you and started begging you for a referral, would you give them one? Probably not. However, 
            if that same person showed genuine interest and passion in what you do and was able to hold an interesting conversation, you might even refer them
            without them asking. This feels like something out of the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene but being likeable is very important to be successful!
        </p>

        <p>
            People love talking about themselves. It's basic human psychology. Look up the person you're meeting on LinkedIn, learn a little about their past & interests,
            and setup a few genuine questions from which you can later branch and start a conversation. I'd recommend not to blatantly ask for a referral unless it gets brought up 
            in the conversation. It just gives off the feeling that that was the only reason you wanted to chat with them in the first place. It makes people feel used.
        </p>

        <p>
            People also love feeling seen. After you meet anyone new, reach out to them on LinkedIn, talk about how you really enjoyed the conversation you had with them and
            bonus points for if you can mention a minor detail. This'll make them feel like "oh wow no way they remembered that" and hopefully you'll stay in their head for a while.
        </p>

      </div>
      
      <div className='space-y-2 mb-6'>
        <p>
          At this point you should have decent skills and a network you can rely on. Now, you'll start the actual application process. 
          Of course, there is no order to do this in but I think having a network before applying could help.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applying is hard. Nowadays, it's common for people to put in 250+ applications before even landing an interview. You must treat it like a full-time job. Apply everywhere
          but put in extra effort at the places you think you have connections. Remember that one campus recruiter you met last fall at your campus fair? 
          Will they remember you? Likely not, but reach out to them anyway incase they do. If you've been following my tips, they likely will remember you cause you complimented their 
          shirt or something along those lines.

        <div className='space-y-2'>
          
          <p>
            Follow a template and keep it a page in length. Do you know how long a recruiter takes to scan your 
            resume? <a href='https://www.tealhq.com/post/how-long-recruiters-spend-reviewing-resume' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='underline'>An average of 7-9 seconds</a> which makes easy readability key.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many different templates to follow but choose one which is plain and tidy. Avoid a lot of colours and images that could distract the 
            recruiter from the actual bullet points and experiences on the resume. Make sure everything is in-line, the same font, size, etc... nothing should look off.
            Let's go in order from top to bottom of what your resume should be structured like:
          </p>

          <p>
            Include your legal name, contact info, general address, GitHub profile, and portfolio link if you have one. Save and store whatever template you use here as if you have to create a cover letter,
            its advised to use the same header as the one on your resume for consistency.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my opinion, a professional summary is not needed. It's long, tedious to read and recruiters simply don't look at it for long enough. If they spend time reading the summary, they won't even get to the experiences and what not.
            Situations when you can include a summary is if you feel like your resume is not packed enough (ideally you should still try to fill it with some projects and what not). In this case, keep it short, concise and easy to read. Avoid 
            using overcomplicated words. A good communicator easily gets their point across, not show off how many big words they know.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's debatable whether your education should be listed as the first thing on your resume or your skills. It doesn't really matter as long as they are both well made. For the education section, include ONLY your university involvement. 
            List your degree name, expected graduation date, and achievements/clubs/courses.
          </p>

          <p>
            List experiences relevant to the job description. If you're applying to a Software Engineering Intern position, sure you're experience at Shopper's is nice 
            but is not as valuable on the resume as a relevant experience would be. If you don't have any relevant experiences, sign up for volunteer opportunities at your school.
            Some clubs offer initiatives which provide resume-worthy experiences. If you don't have access to this, build meaningful projects. Tie it back to the points discussed earlier
            of not copying a random idea. A pro-tip would be to brainstorm how you spend your week and write down the most annoying problems you face going about your day and think of 
            projects that could solve them. That way you have a great project AND something that saved you a lot of pain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your resume's bullet points should follow the "[enter an action verb] [enter thing made] which resulted in [enter estimated number]% better efficiency in our system." 
            I'd recommend you only use the action verbs which are listed 
            on <a href='https://hls.harvard.edu/bernard-koteen-office-of-public-interest-advising/opia-job-search-toolkit/action-verbs/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='underline'>Harvard's list of Action Verbs</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            As we enter the more modern age where everything is digitized, I'd recommend to have links all over your resume. A link to your GitHub for each project you list, a link to the companies website for any experiences you have, 
            and links to your contact infos such as a mailto: for your email, link to your LinkedIn, and link to your portfolio. I would still recommend having another version of your resume which has the links fully typed out incase 
            you have to give a physical copy to someone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Try to not include any experiences from highschool. These are primitive and not credible enough to list on a professional resume. Include a skills sections where you list the tech you're comfortable with. 
            An interests/hobbies section is optional. If you don't have enough experience/projects, you can add it as a last resort just to fill in the space. Lastly, avoid any white spaces which could make your resume feel empty.
          </p>

          <p>
            Check 
            out <a href='https://www.mahadhssn.com/#/resume' className='underline'>my resume</a> for

          No one likes writing cover letters. I'd even argue that no one likes reading them. However, a good few applications still
          require you to submit one. So, let's make the best one possible.
